# Notes about YAML in Visual Studio Code

## Introduction
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files and data exchange formats.

## Syntax
- YAML uses indentation to represent data hierarchy, similar to Python.
- Data structures like lists and dictionaries are represented using a combination of indentation and punctuation characters.
- YAML files typically end with the `.yaml` or `.yml` extension.

## Example
```yaml
